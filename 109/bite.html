<p>In this Bite you learn how to lookup values from a dictionary or in Python: <code>dict</code>.</p><p>You are presented with <code>workout_schedule</code> with keys: days and values: workouts. Complete <code>get_workout_motd</code> that receives a day string, title case it so the function can receive case insensitive days, look it up in the dict and do two things:<ul><li>If the day (key) is not in the dictionary, raise a <code>KeyError</code>, we don't want this function to continue, the caller needs to catch this exception,</li><li>If the key is in the dictionary, return <code>chill</code> or <code>go_train</code> depending if it's a <i>Rest</i> day or not. The latter you will need to string-interpolate using <code>format</code>.</li></p>
